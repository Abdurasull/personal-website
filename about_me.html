        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I am Azim Pulat, a <b>Software Engineer at Google</b> from Uzbekistan, currently living in Warsaw, Poland.
            <br/><br/>
            I am always contributing to developer events by giving a talk or as a mentor, especially the ones that engage women in tech. As a developer, I really want to see more diversity in the industry.

            Recently I experimented working standing and found it really useful to stay focused and a little healthier. I was able to transform my workstation with the books I read.

        <p>
            I am also known as <b>"lazy programmer"</b>, very handy nature for programmers. I love repetitive tasks, I see them as an opportunity for automation. Also, whenever I am not working standing, you find me working laying on a sofa.

        In short, it's me, Azimjon, a friendly programmer from Uzbekistan. You can read my story of becoming a software engineer <a href="#">here</a>.
